A ball starts from the bottom-left corner of the screen, being thrown in random directions, and will bounce off the edges of the screen.
You have to try to catch the ball, in 10 seconds, with the small basket initially placed in the middle of the screen.
You can move the basket using the keys s=left, d=right, x=down, e=up.
The code tries to "move" the ball on the screen as realistic as possible, using fixed point math, including trigonometric functions.
